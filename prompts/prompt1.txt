A lone cyberpunk man stands under a flickering neon sign in a rainy futuristic city street at night, continuing from the reference frame.

He slowly raises his head and exhales vapor into the cold air.
Captured in a medium shot from a slight low angle, the focus is on his cybernetic jawline, glowing neck implants, and wet leather jacket.
Neon reflections ripple across puddles on the ground, while holographic ads drift in the background.

Rain falls steadily, illuminated by pink and cyan lights.
Pedestrians with umbrellas and augmented limbs move indistinctly behind him.

Mood: tense, restrained, anticipatory.
Style: realistic cyberpunk, cinematic lighting, high detail.
Camera: stable, shallow depth of field.
