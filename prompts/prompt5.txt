A quiet CG wide shot at dawn.

One man stands alone on a bridge, city skyline behind him.
The neon lights are fading, replaced by soft morning light.
His expression is calm but heavy, suggesting the cost of truth.

The city continues moving beneath him, indifferent.

Mood: reflective, unresolved, meaningful.
Style: cinematic CG, subdued color palette.
