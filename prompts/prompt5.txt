Using the final combat frame as reference, the scene settles into calm aftermath.

The man stands alone at the alley exit, overlooking a vast cyberpunk city skyline at night.
Captured in a wide shot from behind, his silhouette is framed against towering skyscrapers, neon grids, and flying vehicles.

His coat flutters gently as rain slows to a mist.
City lights pulse rhythmically, reflecting off wet surfaces.

The man remains motionless, scanning the horizon as distant sirens echo.

Mood: reflective, solitary, unresolved.
Style: epic cyberpunk realism, atmospheric depth.
Camera: static wide shot, deep focus.
