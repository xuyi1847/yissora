A stylized CG medium shot of two Chinese men standing side by side in a crowded city street.

One man looks nervous and intelligent, eyes constantly scanning his surroundings.
The other stands relaxed, exaggerated in posture, chewing gum with careless confidence.

Neon light splits their faces—cool blue on the serious man, warm red on the comedic one.
Crowds move in fast motion behind them, while they remain sharp and still.

Mood: contrast, humor, partnership.
Style: cinematic CG, shallow depth of field.
