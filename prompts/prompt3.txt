Using the last frame as reference, the man turns sharply into a narrow alleyway.

The scene shifts to a tight medium shot from behind his shoulder, emphasizing tension and spatial compression.
Steam rises from vents along the walls, mixing with rain and neon glow.

Three shadowy figures emerge at the far end of the alley, their red optical implants igniting simultaneously.
The man’s cybernetic eyes activate, faint UI elements reflecting across his pupils.

Mood: imminent danger, heightened awareness.
Style: dark cyberpunk noir, high contrast lighting.
Camera: slow push-in, handheld micro-shake.
