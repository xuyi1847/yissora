A cinematic CG shot of a well-dressed, calm man standing alone in a quiet urban interior, inspired by a modern Asian metropolis.

Captured in a medium-wide static shot, the man faces away from the camera at first.
Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal the city at night behind him, lights forming a cold geometric grid.

He slowly turns his head just enough to reveal one eye catching the light.
His expression is composed, intelligent, and unreadable.

The environment is minimal—clean lines, reflective surfaces, controlled lighting.
No chaos, no crowds, no motion.

Mood: controlled, threatening, intellectual.
Style: cinematic CG, restrained color palette, high contrast lighting.
Camera: locked-off shot, no movement.
