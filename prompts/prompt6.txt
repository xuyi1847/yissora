Continuing from the previous reference frame, the cyberpunk man steps forward onto a rooftop edge overlooking the city.

Captured in a medium-wide shot from a slightly elevated rear angle, the focus is on his upper body silhouette and exposed cybernetic spine, faintly glowing beneath his jacket.
He raises his mechanical hand and projects a translucent holographic data interface into the air.

Neon city lights pulse below, while flying vehicles pass at different depths, establishing strong spatial layering.
The hologram displays scrolling symbols, waveform graphs, and fragmented face profiles, softly illuminating his face.

A warm-cool contrast forms between the cyan hologram light and the magenta city glow.
Wind moves his coat and loose cables subtly, reinforcing realism.

Mood: awakening, control, silent dominance.
Style: realistic cyberpunk, high-detail holographic effects.
Camera: slow orbital movement, smooth and deliberate.
Lighting: neon backlight with soft hologram key light.
